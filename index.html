                    <h2>OLYMPICS</h2>
                    <p>In 1900, 1904, 1908, and 1920, archery was a part of the Olympic program. After a 52-year break,
                        it made a comeback in 1972 and has been a part of the show ever since. Recurve bows are used by
                        competitors in target archery competitions at the Olympics. Based on early results, Hubert van
                        Innis of Belgium and Kim Soo-Nyung of Korea are the two most successful Olympians in the sport
                        of archery. The only archer to have won the individual Olympic title twice is Darrell Pace of
                        the USA. The country with the most Olympic success in archery is Korea.</p>

                    <h2>WORLD GAMES</h2>
                    <p>Since 1985, archery has been a part of the World Games schedule. Before the compound bow was
                        introduced in 1995, field archery competitions were only open to recurve and barebow archers.
                        The target archery discipline was added to the compound competition in 2013. The compound men's
                        field archery event was won three times by Morgan Lundin, who is the most successful archer at
                        the World Games in 1993, 1997, and 2005.</p>

            <h1>TYPE OF BOWS</h1>
            <p>A bow consists of a semi-rigid but elastic arc with a high-tensile bowstring joining the ends of the two
                limbs of the bow. An arrow is a projectile with a projected tip and a long shaft with fins (fletching)
                towards the back, with a narrow notch (nock) at the very end to contact the bowstring.</p>
            <section>

                    <h2>Recurve or Classical bow</h2>
                    <p>The curved branches and more massive handle of the recurve bow make it easy to identify. It can
                        be used instinctively without a sighting device, but attachments like a stabilizer, a sight, and
                        vibration dampers can be enhanced. It comes in a variety of shapes and weights, up to 40 pounds
                        for adult recreational shooting.</p>

                    <h2>Straight or Longbow</h2>
                    <p>Another common traditional bow is the longbow, which is big (2 meters), straight, and D-shaped.
                        Depending on your morphology, straight bows can now be found in a variety of sizes. It is
                        constructed from a single block of yew, boxwood, or glued wood laminate. It is a medieval
                        English bow with instinctive shooting that is only used by experienced archers who practice
                        natural shooting.
                        The longbow has a weight range of 25 to 60 pounds. For the competition, wood must be used to
                        make the arrows.</p>

                    <h2>Compound bow</h2>
                    <p>The Compound is a bow that has a system of hoists that increases the power and speeds up the
                        propulsion of the arrows. Size, length, and power are only a few of the many selection factors.
                        The power of leisure bows can be as little as 12 lbs (for kids) or as high as 75 lbs (for
                        hunting bows). The use of higher powers will be limited to hunting.
                        On American design, it is mostly utilized for target shooting, hunting, and outdoor activities.

                    <h2>Barebow</h2>
                    <p>The barebow is a classic recurve or longbow that may be shot without the use of accessories such
                        a sight, stabilizer, range indicator, or aiming mark. It is used in some field shooting
                        contests. All of the bow's decorations have been removed, perhaps with the exception of the
                        button-berger.</p>

                    <h2>Survival bow</h2>
                    <p>Small, foldable longbows are essentially what survival bows are. This implies that they have far
                        less power than a takedown recurve bow. However, the majority of survival bows can fire
                        precisely up to 30 yards, which is more than sufficient for deer hunting, particularly in a
                        survival situation.</p>

                    <h2>The Japanese bow or Yumi</h2>
                    <p>The Kuydo martial art, which is a legacy of the Samurai, is practiced with a traditional Japanese
                        bow called the Yumi. Fiber or carbon, which were originally made of bamboo, are acceptable. The
                        bow's asymmetrical handle is in the lower third and is only held with the left hand. The
                        extremely long bow, which is over two meters long, is unequipped. The Ya is the name of the
                        Japanese arrow. It can be made of carbon fiber, bamboo, or aluminum.</p>

                        • There are no re-shot’s allowed.<br>
                        • Athletes can be penalized, disqualified, or even banned for breaching rules.<br>

                    <p>There are common guidelines that archers adhere to, even though some techniques may vary, to help
                        assure accuracy when shooting. These guidelines obviously do not apply to all forms of archery,
                        but they will give you a general sense of how it works. Ready? Here we go, then!

                    <h2>Proper stance</h2>
                    <p>Line up, so your feet are in a line towards the middle of the target. Your feet should be
                        shoulder width apart, and your toes should be pointing at a 90-degree angle from the target. In
                        other words, if you drew an imaginary line from the center of the target, it would hit the side
                        of your foot.</p>

                    <p>Put the arrow on the arrow rest, which is part of the bow. Place the bowstring into the nock,
                        which is the slotted portion on the back of an arrow. Usually, the fletching, or the feather or
                        plastic stabilizing portion of the bow, will have one that is odd colored, as you can see in the
                        image below. Point the odd-colored fletch outward.</p>

                    <p>Typically, three fingers are used to hold the string. The pointer finger is held above the arrow,
                        and the middle and ring finger are below the arrow. The grip should be loose.</p>

                    <h2>Draw the bow & Aim</h2>
                    <p>Raise the bow and draw, or pull the string back. Your bow arm, or the arm that is not drawing the
                        string, should be pointed toward the target. Next, draw the string toward an anchor point. This
                        varies depending on whether or not you're using a sight. Anchor points are typically the chin,
                        corner of the mouth, or ear. <br> Some people aim with a sight, others do not.

                        the arrow. Stay in the stance until the arrow hits the target as to not move while the arrow is
                        being released.

                        receive for shooting one arrow is one point (hitting the outer white ring) while the highest
                        score possible is ten points (hitting the inner gold ring).</p>

                        who has the highest cumulative score after all the arrows have been shot, or the archer has

                        Paralympic movement's history and has been on the schedule of every competition.
                        Para-archery, which includes standing and wheelchair events, is available to competitors with
                        physical disabilities in the Paralympic Games. Ten scoring zones are indicated on the target,
                        and athletes shoot at it from a distance.
                        Every two years, World Archery hosts the World Archery Para Championships, an international
                        competition for para archers.

                    <p>Target archery is practiced using recurve bows prior to the Olympics. Athletes engage in
                        head-to-head competition to score set points—2 points for winning a set and 1 point for tying a
                        set—firing at targets 70 meters away. The first player to score 6 set points wins the match.
                        Olympic archery competitions are held in the form of the World Archery Field Championships and
                        are held every two years. It was first hosted in 1969.
